# Why am I doing this?
By Peter Zezima

In 2002-2003 I was a paying member of Runescape, one day from what I can recall it was either Mod Ronan or Mod Mark accused me of botting, I was admittedly using an auto click wich simply fired the left mouse click button repeatedly every second - however no complex fully automated bots or scripts.

I was a lonely and very depressed teenager at the time who's only respite was doing silly things on Runescape, by no means was I a wealthy Runescape player with only 200,000 GP and level stats of 56 max and lower, full rune because other players where kind to me and the GP generated though my obsession of fletching which I was level 54 and woodcutting 58. Excited to start fletching yew bows where the real Runescape GP was at.

48 hours after the Jagex mod accusing me of botting I log into my account to find all of the contents to that account having been taken from my bank, all my runes, amour and countless hours of work stolen and my player character left dumped in an unusual place.

There were no intrusions into my computer and no other accounts affected, just my Runescape account merely hours after a Jagex mod accused me of botting.

Fagex, in my opinion, are utter scum. They have for years been abusing their customer-base which is primarily made of young children and teens, I at the time was in my early teens. However still particularly proficient in computer programming.

Jagex mods have been stealing items from the game accounts of children for years, particularly in the early years, as such, they will be held accountable in coming times - they will eventually be brought to justice, and the cases of such as Mod Jed in 2018 are just the tip of the iceberg.

The cracks in the seems are forming;

RS3 is nothing more than a well-tuned fruit machine targeted at adolescents.

Work with me to destroy the Runescape economy and shine a revealing light upon how Jagex single-handedly demoralise their integrity. It is them whom appointed the mods which carry out these questionable activities thinking that witness statements in the future will not be corroborated due to lack of tangible evidence.

This was merely and under-sight on their behalf as the company they have worked so hard to build over the years will now be held question to as a matter of fraud to which they must have been privy to if not at least allowed the facilitation to take place within their company by operating with very little respect to data protection laws of that current age.

Death to Fagex.

*Those that they've wronged grow older and more powerful with time, the kids they once deemed powerless are now the adults whom will slay the wicked old men that they chose to become.*
